# Exercise 4.14
"""Generate single-digit multiplication problems
4.14 (COMPUTER-ASSISTED INSTRUCTION) Computer-assisted instruction (CAI) 
refers to the use of computers in education. Write a script to help an 
elementary school student learn multiplication. Create a function that 
randomly generates and returns a tuple of two positive one-digit integers.
Use that functionâ€™s result in your script to prompt the user with a question,
such as:
     How much is 6 times 7?

For a correct answer, display the message "Very good!" and ask another
multiplication question. For an incorrect answer, display the message "No. 
Please try again." and let the student try the same question repeatedly
until the student finally gets it right.
